              I was reflecting on life, where I came from, what
happened, all the hard work, and the beautiful life
C.A.’s 12 Step program has given me.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base/7 text-gray-600">
              As a child I was trafficked from 2-13yrs old, and
I held the trauma and resentment deep in every cell of
my body. My mother knew what was happening and
her father was my trafficker. Anytime I would tell
anyone she would convince them I was lying and
dubbed me the dirty little liar.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base/7 text-gray-600">
                As much as I hated her for that was as much as I
wanted her to love me. She either could not or would
not give me what I desperately craved.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base/7 text-gray-600">
                I’d already had dope in my tiny little body to
make me docile and less likely to fight back, so I never
stopped using. I was like a feral child, teenager and
adult that used to die and died to use.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base/7 text-gray-600">
                I blamed EVERYONE else for my poor
behaviour, decisions and the harm I caused others. I
resented anyone with a “normal” life, but the
resentment towards my mother is what drove me
insane.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base/7 text-gray-600">
                While doing my step work, I argued with my
sponsor I could never forgive because she was never
sorry. I asked what part did I play? I was an innocent
child!! She explained that my part was expecting my
mother to be a mother, loving, caring, protective, and
for whatever reason she couldn’t. (My mother has her
own traumatic story)
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base/7 text-gray-600">
                Something in me changed in that moment. I
thought about all the trauma my using and behaviour
did to my own children because I was not equipped to
deal with life after trauma, but I could break the cycle
and heal.
That I could forgive my own mother without an
apology or accountability… I wanted to be better and
do better and it all had to end and start with me.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base/7 text-gray-600">
                I’m eternally grateful my sponsor was able to
strip back all the feelings I’d held onto so I could see
the truth and change my life. I’ve been able to heal
and move forward with many blessings including
healing with my children. I’m no longer a
“Resentments Slave”.
