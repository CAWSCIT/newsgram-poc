What’s more beautiful is how these relationships
have evolved over time. As I’ve grown in the program
I’ve had the privilege of sponsoring others. At first my
role was to guide them through The Steps and help
them stay sober but what unfolded was so much more,
many of my sponsees have become some of my
closest friends. We’ve gone on vacations together, not
just for conventions, but for the pure joy of living life
clean and connected. Whether it's road-tripping to the
beach, walking through Central Park, or just escaping
the city for a weekend getaway, these trips have
solidified our bonds and reminded me of how far
we've come.

It’s funny, when I look back at my life before I
got sober I realize how few true friendships I actually
had. To this day I can count on one hand the number
of people from that part of my life that I still speak to,
just three. And even those relationships have changed
because I’ve changed, I’m not the same person I was
before 1993. Recovery hasn’t just given me a new life,
it’s given me a new heart, a new mind, and a new way
of connecting with others.

Today, almost all of my friends come from the
rooms of Cocaine Anonymous. They understand me in
a way that no one else can because they’ve walked the
same path. They know what it’s like to feel hopeless
and to rediscover hope. They know what it means to
make amends, to forgive, and to grow.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
We’ve celebrated milestones together, from 30-day
chips to 30-year anniversaries and we’ve stood by one
another in times of loss, grief, and hardship. Our
friendships are forged not in convenience or
proximity, but in shared experience and spiritual
growth.

My sister often tells me “You have a lot of
friends”, she’s right and I never get tired of hearing it
because it wasn’t always that way. I remember feeling
completely alone in my addiction convinced that no one
could possibly understand or care. And yet here I am living
a life filled with companionship, laughter, and love. That
abundance is a direct result of the Fellowship of Cocaine
Anonymous. It’s because of C.A. that I’m no longer
isolated, it’s because of C.A. that I’ve built a network
of friends who not only accept me but inspire me to
be my best self.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
Now, as I prepare for a big transition, my move
to Texas in November of 2025, I find myself
reflecting on just how much the Fellowship has given
me. Of course I’ll miss my New York crew, the
parades the spontaneous dinners, the late-night phone
calls. But I also feel an incredible sense of excitement
because I know without a doubt that C.A. exists in
Texas too. And that means new meetings, new faces,
and new friends waiting to be made.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
I don’t fear the move I embrace it, recovery has
taught me how to be open, how to show up and how
to build connections no matter where I go. I know that
the Principles of this Program are universal, and the
Fellowship extends beyond state lines. I’ve already
started researching meetings in my future city and I’m
looking forward to walking into those rooms as a
newcomer to the area, but not a newcomer to the way
of life that has sustained me for over 30 years.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
I also look forward to bringing the spirit of my
New York Fellowship with me. I’ll carry the lessons,
the laughter and the love that my friends here have
given me and who knows maybe some of them will
come visit. Maybe we’ll find new parades to attend,
new places to watch fireworks, and new adventures to
go on together, just like old times in a new place.
              </p>

Friendship in recovery is not just about having
people to hang out with, it’s about accountability,
vulnerability, and mutual growth. It’s about walking
hand in hand with others as we navigate this wild and
wonderful journey of sobriety. And it’s about
celebrating the miracle of being alive, clean, and
connected.
</p>
            <p className="mb-4">
I often think of the phrase we hear in the rooms
“You’ll find a life beyond your wildest dreams”. That
life for me has never been about material success or
fame, it’s been about relationships, the deep soulnourishing kind that recovery makes possible. It’s
about sitting at a diner after a meeting laughing so
hard your stomach hurts. It’s about showing up for
someone when they need you most, it’s about being
part of something greater than yourself.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  Thirty-plus years ago I never would’ve
imagined the kind of friendships I have today. But
here I am, living proof that recovery works and that
Fellowship heals. I am beyond grateful for every
person who has walked with me on this journey from
my first sponsor to my newest sponsee, they’ve all
played a role in shaping the life I live today.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  As I look ahead to the next chapter in Texas my
heart is full, I’m not just moving I’m expanding.
Expanding my horizons, my heart, and my circle of
friends, and I can't wait to see what and who is
waiting for me on the other side.
