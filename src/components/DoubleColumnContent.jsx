Mentally I was really weak, the chatter of a
thousand monkeys in my head kept me restless,
irritable, and discontent. One of the most confusing
things was why my second family did not take me
back; I did everything I was told but my wife said she
had no feelings for me.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">

I was still very much short tempered and
demanding, like a child I was stomping my feet
because nothing was going my way. I was reluctant to
seek help from support groups like A.A. and N.A., like
I said I thought it was for a bunch of losers, some kind
of cult full of bible bashers.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">

It wasn’t until I stumbled into Cocaine
Anonymous that I heard something different, they
didn’t just talk about stopping they spoke about living
in the real solution. A spiritual program of action not
just words, not just meetings, but action.
Something inside me resisted at first, half
measures had been my way of life, but in C.A. I
learned that “Half Measures Availed Us Nothing
“(From A.A. page 59). If I wanted to recover I had to
go all in, two feet in, at all times.
Though I was against seeking such support I
dragged myself to those meetings every day for a
couple of months. That's where I learned that I have to
recover not to get my family back but recover for my
own self first.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">

To my surprise I actually met some really
wonderful people with whom I am now friends with.
The people I was surrounded by had various sobriety
times and each shared how they dealt with hurdles.
But most importantly they didn’t want anything from
me they just gave me a hug and wished me to get well.
Through working the program I started to see the
truth. My biggest obstacles weren’t drugs or alcohol,
but my selfishness, self-centeredness, self-delusion,
self-seeking, and self-pity. These had poisoned my life
more than any substance ever could. I had to face
them to take responsibility and to let go of the old
patterns that had kept me sick for so long.
</p>

As a newcomer you are weak so it is suggested
to find yourself a sponsor who will take you through
each of the 12 Steps thoroughly.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">

I had to be honest for the first time in my life, I had to
open up about things I thought I'd take to the grave.
For instance, as we worked slowly through each step
my 4th Step showed me that I should be dead and
definitely should be grateful for being alive today. My
sponsor helped me understand and control my thought
flow, what were the actual reasons for my actions and
disruptive behaviour.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">

With the guidance of my sponsor and his no
excuse attitude I was forced to accept that soon I
would have to make amends to everyone I hurt.
I can say right now as I write this that I managed
to make amends to my father in time. I built a
relationship, a great friendship with him from the
moment I made amends to the moment he passed 6th
Jan 2021. I have priceless memories of getting a first
hug and kiss on the forehead when I made amends to
him and only have one regret which is of not seeking
recovery sooner.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">

As I came to terms with him passing away it has
been difficult and thoughts of using came and went but
the tools of recovery work, they have kept me clean
and sober.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">

The C.A. group's support is amazing, it feels like
you are never alone and genuinely there is no excuse to
pick up now.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">

I am no longer the Jekyll and Hyde character I
used to be. I have learned to utilize the tools that were
given to me by the program and they help me deal with
everything that life throws at me. I also keep an eye on
my character defects which sometimes is not easy, but
I can laugh at them now and stay positive.
One day at a time I have managed to stay clean
and sober. The restless nights, the inner turmoil, the
stinking thinking has all faded. Not because life got
easier but because I found a way to live with life on
life’s terms.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">

Today I stay in service, unity, and recovery
because that is what keeps me grounded. I give back
what was freely given to me, I listen, I learn and I
show up. I no longer search for an escape because I
have found a way to live a way that is real,
meaningful, and full of purpose.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">

The problem was never the drugs, the problem
was me, but today I am free.
