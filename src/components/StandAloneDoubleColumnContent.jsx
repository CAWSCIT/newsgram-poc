This was a huge issue for me in early recovery, I
felt like the lowest of the low when I crawled through
the doors. I had done so many things that I was full of
guilt, shame, and remorse, I didn't feel like I deserved
anything good. (That last part was actually pretty true,
if I got what I truly deserved I would be doing 25 to
life!)
</p><p className="mb-4">
I had a hard time with the word humility, I had
absolutely zero understanding of the word. I would
hear it and immediately think of the word
“humiliation” and again immediately went to the
horrible things I had been doing my whole life.
</p><p className="mb-4">
A lot of them were done stone cold sober and I
couldn’t blame drugs and alcohol. I had been around
a little while and was convinced I suffered from the
selfishness and self centeredness that the big book of
Alcoholics Anonymous talks about. But how could I
be so self-centered and still suffer from low selfesteem? it made no sense to me.
</p><p className="mb-4">
One day in a meeting I heard a young lady share
about being an egomaniac with an inferiority complex
and I had one of those huge aha moments! that’s
exactly how I had been feeling for ages.
</p><p className="mb-4">
So now that I have a name for what I have been
feeling what do I do about it? Thank God for the
program. I had to continue to do inventory, to try to
do some things differently, like putting others ahead of
myself, and keeping focused on that decision made in
Step Three.
</p><p className="mb-4">
I had issues with putting too much emphasis on
the Fellowship instead of God and the program. When
I started to embrace some positive thinking instead of
negative thinking my thoughts began to change.
</p><p className="mb-4">
A dear friend gave me a positive affirmation to
use, “I am the woman that God is with”. After all I
had been reading and hearing “there is One who has
all power may you find Him now”, and what better
way than finding a God personal to me. I found I had
to get into action, this is what the program was all
about, doing things differently.
</p><p className="mb-4">
Someone saw something in me and encouraged
me to get into service starting at the group level.
Service work was a huge Godsend for me and more of
the promises began to come true in my life. It felt like
I had been given a true purpose in my life, something I
had never experienced before.
