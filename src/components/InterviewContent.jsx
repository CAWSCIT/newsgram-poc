<strong>GINGER L.</strong>: Hello, this is Ginger L. (Archivist) from
the C.A. World Service Archive Committee and I am
here with Steve A. on September 23rd, 2023. Do I
have your permission to record this interview for the
posterity of Cooking Anonymous?
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
<strong>STEVE A.</strong>: Yes.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
<strong>GINGER L.</strong>: What is your sobriety date and what
drugs did you use?
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
<strong>STEVE A.</strong>: March 10th, 1989. All of them but
primarily alcohol, cocaine, speed, marijuana, hashish,
had some heroin, had some peyote, and a little LSD.
Had some pharmaceuticals that I had to carry around a
PDR (Physician’s Desk Reference) to know what was
going to happen.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
<strong>GINGER L.</strong>: And how were you first introduced to
C.A.?
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
<strong>STEVE A.</strong>: I was preparing to rob a convenience
store on Thomas and 28th Street at 2.30 in the
morning and I needed money for more dope. So I go
to the payphone, they’re the things you put quarters in,
and as I’m standing at the payphone, I look across the
street and there's five police officers parked, and I said
well I don't think I better do it right now.
So, I took the phone book up, they had phone
books on them in those days, I open it up and it
opened up to the C’s and I look and there's Cocaine
Anonymous.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
I dial the number and this man by the name of
Paul answered, Preacher Paul listened to my tirade
about all the shit that's wrong in the world for about
two hours, and I even explained to him how Cocaine
Anonymous could be fixed. He told me at the end of
the call, maybe you ought to come help us Steve, and I
said well I can't do it right now. He says but we're
gonna have a meeting on Sunday morning up on the
mountain on Squaw Peak. I said that's just a bunch of
picnic tables up there. And he says yeah and we have a
bunch of people that get together on Sunday morning
and they have a meeting, I said okay well maybe when
its time.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
Probably a month or a month and a half later I
went up to that meeting and it was at a Ramada on the
side away from the mountain and there were 15 to 18
people up there. To get there I had to park down here
and have to go a whole bunch of steps. I get up there
and one other person that’s there is a young man that
used to go to school with my son and they used to see
all my dope. He came over and we talked, he wanted
to know why I was there.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
He was giving the chips out and he says
anybody want a newcomer chip, and I just sat there,
and he says Steve don't you want a newcomer chip? I
said okay and I went up and he handed me the chip.
He said now tell everybody who you are, I said
well my name is Steve A., and then he says so why are
you here? A couple other people went up before me
and admitted that they were addicts, so I said well I'm
an addict, and it tore me up because I'm 46 years old
and it is the first time I can ever remember being
honest. I went away from that meeting and I went out
and got loaded, I just couldn't stand the pain, and that
was my first meeting.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
<strong>GINGER L.</strong>: What C.A. meetings did you go to
regularly?
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
<strong>STEVE A.</strong>: A friend of mine had about 60 days sober
and I said so how do you get 60 days because I
couldn't get two days. He says I'm doing 90 in 90, I
said what's that? 90 meetings in 90 days? So okay the
next day after that meeting on the mountain I went to
another meeting, I listened to a lot of war stories
because Cocaine Anonymous was really big about that
back then and I went out and got loaded again. The
next day I got up and I went to work because Im not
going to do this again.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
At the end of my workday I went to an A.A.
meeting, (So I went to the bar instead). I did that for
30 days, I went to a meeting every day drunk, going to
get drunk, loaded, going to get loaded, for ten to thirty
days. At the meeting they said anyone got 30 days and
I raised my hand and I went down and I got a 30 day
keychain. I did another 30 days and it was the same routine, I’d go to the
meetings, sit in the back and wouldn't listen.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
My wife asked me what we were doing and I
was so full of lies. I came home one time and said
well I didn't have the money for a Big Book so I
bought a little book but the little book was the 12 and
12 so I had a 12 and 12 before I had a Big Book.
They had a 60 day (chip) where I went out and I
got loaded every night, who's got 60 days? I raised my
hand, I went and I got my 60 day chip for attending
these meetings every day, that's what I was thinking
anyway.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
I went out another 30 days and at 90 days I'm
back up on the mountain. The same kids are giving
away the chips. Anyone got 90 days? I went up and
got my chip, I had cocaine in my moustache and there
was blood running down my arm, I was so wacked. He
gave me the keychain and he hugged me and he said
Steve, when you get honest I'll give you a 10 year
chip.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
So that's kind of what I did. We had such great
names for meetings back then, the meeting on the
mountain was “ Way Off Base.”, Monday night we
had “ Monday Night Alternative ” and the “ Razor’s
Edge ”, Tuesdays we had “ Coke Busters ”,
Wednesday we had the “ Asbury Meeting ”, Thursday
we had the “ Men's Group ”, and it was at the Asbury
church, Friday we had “ Torchlight ” but we also had “
Last Straw ” at the Camelback Hospital.
The first meeting that was in the valley was on
Monday night in Scottsdale called “ Classic Coke ”,
we had “ Saturday Night Alternative “ and “ SNL”,
and Sunday we had “ Diet Coke ”. After “ SNL “ out
by Pinnacle Peak, they had a pig roasting meeting and
we would go there and have a barbecue and some
Fellowshipping, and I went to them all.
C.A. (when I first started going) was just over
four years old. When I’d go to the meeting on Sunday
and Monday the same people were always there, all 14
of us. And when I go to the meeting on Tuesday,
same people, Wednesday, same people, every night
was the same people.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
We were just holding on, we were scared
shitless we were going to die so we held on to each
other and we talked about sick cats, we talked about
the horrible roommate we had, we talked about our
jobs, but we didn't talk much about recovery or about
the steps. We just held on to each other, nobody knew
how to do this thing until we started that men's step
study.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
We took it from the Friday night men's step
study and also moved it to the Thursday men's group
where we were using a Big Book, and then Saturday
morning we had a Big Book study at Asbury Church.
They came to me and said we need at least $10 a
week, I said I can't do that there's only three or four of
us here every week so I moved the meeting to my
house.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
I asked Bonnie who was going to the meeting
with me and a couple of guys I was sponsoring, this is
after 45 days, and home from recovering for only 15.
So I moved it to my house, in the first meeting we had
Saturday morning there were three of us, Bonnie, John
and myself.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
The next week there were 10 and then 20, the
week after that there was 35, and the week after that
we had to move it outside.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
And we talked about recovery, we read a
passage from the Big Book and the discussion would
take the rest of the day. It was just phenomenal when
their hearts opened up and the honestly came out and
people just learned to love each other.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
<strong>GINGER L.</strong>: So to back up a little bit, did you ever
get your 10 year chip from that guy that said he would
give you a 10 year chip?
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
<strong>STEVE A.</strong>: I did, I did, in fact he was around to give
me my 30 year chip.
